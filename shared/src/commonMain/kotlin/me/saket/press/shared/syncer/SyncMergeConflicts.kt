/**
 * Holds note IDs that are in a conflicted state right during sync. Notes can remain in a
 * conflicted state temporarily while [GitSyncer] resolves them. This state isn't persisted
 * across process deaths because notes are guaranteed to be conflict-free once the ongoing
 * sync completes successfully. In case sync fails or the app is killed midway, [GitSyncer]
 * discards all upstream changes on the next sync attempt, clearing any dangling merge
 * conflicts.
 *
 * [EditorPresenter] uses this for blocking editing of conflicted notes, asking the user to
 * re-open the note once conflicts have been resolved.
